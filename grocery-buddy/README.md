## Grocery Buddy

- Grocery Buddy is a classic todo list app that I created using the React useState hook.
- It also utilizes local storage, making the list items persistent when added or edited.
- Additionally, it provides popup notifications during the add and delete stages, and warning notification if an invalid value is entered.
- This project has been a valuable contribution to my learning journey with React.
