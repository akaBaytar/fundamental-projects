## Fundamental Projects

- The 20+ projects in the Fundamental Projects series were created to contribute to my learning process in React.
- Starting with the project of transitioning a project created with vanilla HTML and CSS to React, the series progressed with projects where I used basic React hooks and then delved into more advanced topics.
- By learning concepts like Axios, Tailwind, React Query, React Router, Redux, I concluded the project series with an e-commerce project.
- In this repository, I've included the starter projects and for the other projects, you can access them individually through their own repositories to view the deployed versions.
