## Strapi Dropdown

- Strapi Dropdown is a project where I used the useContext and useRef hooks.
- Inspired by the dropdown menus on the Strapi website.
- I used the Context API for mouse and click events and useRef for closing the dropdown based on the mouse position.
- This project has been a valuable contribution to my learning journey with React.
